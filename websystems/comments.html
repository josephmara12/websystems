        <h1 style="color:#449acc">Reflection</h1>
        <p>I’ve always loved a minimalist, simple and neat design. A great example of a company who thrives using this model is Apple. I aimed to recreate this with my website. There isn’t too much going on with a wide use of negative space, which gives off a ‘cleaner’ look. My webpage is made up of 4 pages all linked to the same css stylesheet in order to provide a consistent feel. I chose to try something different putting the Navbar on the left side of the page rather than the top. There is also no obvious header, as it is essentially ‘invisible’ using just text instead. </p>

                  <td>Nav(anchor tag)</td>
                  <td>The achcor tags were used for navigation and is how I created the navigation bar. When used with the href tag it allowed me to hyperlink the other 3 pages as per the requirements.</td>

                  <td>#box class</td>
                  <td>The box class is used to style all the rounded boxes used in my webpages. The class descibes the width, height and colour. I had to embed the positioning of each box however as the boxes needed to be in specific locations</td>

                  <td>The .ID selector was one of my most used selectors and I tended to implement them more than whole classes as I had many individual items which needed to be positioned rather than a group of elements. For example all the rounded boxes were styled using ID selectors. The reason I didn’t use a class for these was because I needed to position them differently. </td>

                    <td>Div</td>
                    <td>The Div tag was used to split my page into seperate sections. Basically the div tag was used for the Navbar, the main body and the footer. This made styling much easier in terms of positioning as elements were grouped together.</td>

              <h3>Font</h3>
              <p>The font I used for this webpage was Trebuchet MS. It is a humanist sans serif and looks simple and clean, highlighting the intutitive nature of my website. </p>
              <h3>Colour Scheme </h3>
              <img src="/Images/color.png" alt="colour Scheme" style = "position:relative; left:1%; width:300px; height:100px;" >
              <p>I chose to employ a seemingly basic colour scheme using light blues and greys. However, the simplicity is the look I was aiming to achieve. The contrast between the light grey (rgb 219, 214, 214, 0.767) and solid blue (#1e95da) allows users to clearly see content and naviagte around the page.</p>
             

              <h1  style="color:#449acc"> Accessibility</h1>
              <h3>Intuitive </h3>
              <p>I ensured that this website was extremely intuitive allowing any type of user to access all pages and navigate easily around them. Elements that added to this include the ability to hover over links in the navbar, the simplicity of design and the contrasting colour scheme.</p>
              
<h3>Design (Images) </h3>
                  <p>All my images are given an alt> tag so that if the image fails to load user can still see what is meant to be there, giving context to users if not accessible. The images themselves help break the page into sections allowing users to clearly see and read content, essentially not bunching all the words on the page together</p>
                  
                <h3>Structure and design </h3>
                <p>As mentioned above I have designed my website in a way that makes it extremely intuitive for users. This is helped by the simple colour scheme which won’t effect the visually impaired. The contrast between bold blues and light greys really makes certain elements stand out ensuing content is easy to read. The boxes around text are also labeled and draws attention to that segment. </p>
