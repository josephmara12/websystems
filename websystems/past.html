        <p class = 'box' style = "left: 16%; bottom:30px;"> The HSC was a tough and stressful time. I chose to study maths, English, business, economics and IPT. IPT was where I got a taste of what IT would be like in university learning about networks, databases and programming. </p>
        
        <H1 style="left:50%; top:53%; position:fixed;color:#1e95da;">Computing</H1>
        
        <p class = 'box' style ="left: 43%; bottom:30px;"> I have always been interested in computing and it has been a large passion of mine for many years. I first coded a sound button app when I was in year 6. Throughout school I undertook many projects in high-school including building a Unity game, creating a human vs. computer TIC TAC TOE game and creating a fully functional access database. </p>
          
        <H1 style="left:80%; top:53%; position:fixed;color:#1e95da;">Work</H1>
        
        <p class = 'box' style = "right: 3.51%; bottom:29px;">In regards to work, I went straight from school to becoming an ICT assistant helping students with their IT issues whilst also setting up all the devices. I am also currently working at Telstra.  </p>
